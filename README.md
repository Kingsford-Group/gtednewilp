## ILP for Graph traversal edit distance

The code in this repository are for reproducing the results in "Reviting the complexity of and Algorithms for Graph Traversal Edit Distance and its Variants".

### Getting started
Unzip the graphs in `.tar.gz` files and put them in a new directory `data/`.

The program depends on Gurobi.

To run the results on TCR graphs: `python ilp_main_tcr.py`

To run the results on 3cycle graphs: `python ilp_main_3cycle.py`

Please check the input and output file names and locations before running the program.
